# Qelly

Nally, every platform, every machine.


## Introduction

Qelly is a Qt port of Nally, the open-source Telnet/SSH client for Mac OS X.
Qt is chosen to be the underlying framework of this application bacause it
enables us to build a GUI-based application with a native interface for every
operating system with minimal effort. The project is currently only a Qt version
of Nally (hence the name), but more features from other Telnet/SSH clients are
also planned.
